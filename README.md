# What is KYC

The main process behind KYC is that government and enterprises need to track the customers for illegal and money laundering activities. Moreover, KYC also enable banks to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks and make better decisions.

# Need for KYC

Taking in from the origin of KYC, we can state that there are four major sectors in banking where KYC is needed:

Customer Admittance: Making anonymous accounts as restricted entry into the banking system. Preliminary information such as names, birth dates, addresses, contact numbers are to be collected to provide banking service.

Customer Identification: In the case of suspicious banking transactions through a customer, the customer accounts can be tracked and flagged. Further, it can send to process under the bank head office for review.

Monitoring of Bank Activities: Suspicious and doubtful activities in any account can be zeroed in by the bank after understanding its customer base using KYC.

Risk Management: Now that bank has all the preliminary information and activity pattern, it can assess the risk and the likelihood of the customer being involved in illegal transactions.

# Problems/Challenges in KYC

Disparity in Specifications for KYC.

Every bank has their own KYC process setup and customers need to do the KYC again and again for each bank.

Due to lack of KYC standards compiling reach request is time-consuming.

Adverse impact on Customer relationship.

It becomes irksome for the customers to provide the same information to different banking entities and industries.

Banks may even follow up with customers to get more details on KYC.

Escalating Costs and Time for Banks

A recent study concluded that overheads of KYC in a bank increase the onboarding cost for a customer by 18% and the minimum time required to 26 days.

# Solution using Blockchain

The blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger shared with everyone involved in the network. Every participant interacts with the blockchain using a public-private cryptographic key combination. Moreover, immutable record storage is provided, which is very hard to tamper.

 
Banks can utilize the feature set of Blockchain to reduce the difficulties faced by the traditional KYC process. A distributed ledger can be setup between all the banks, where one bank can upload the KYC of a customer and other banks can vote on legitimacy of the customer details. KYC for the customers can be immutably stored and accesses from the Blockchain.
